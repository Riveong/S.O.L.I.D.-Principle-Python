# S.O.L.I.D.-Principle-Python
Solid Principle in Python  
  
# Welcome to Theory Hell  
Here is the testament of SOLID programming. The Bible that unite programmers (am not), To develop softwares that have strong foundations. That's the goal of SOLID Programming.  
  

## SOLID 1:1-10  
In the beginning Robert C. Martin developed the SOLID principles. The design later developed as essay in 2000 with the title:"Design Principles and Design Patterns."  
  
S.O.L.I.D.  
S stands for Single responsibility  
O stands for Open / closed  
L stands for Liskov subtitution  
I stands for Interface segregation  
D stands for Dependencies inversion  
SOLID is a unified principle from some principles.  
  
## SOLID 2 ("The philosophy of SOLID")  
SOLID isn't something that you must do, Something that if you ain't doing it you will get trouble. SOLID is one of many solutions and paradigmn that will help us to write better and cleaner code. To be fair SOLID is the father figure that we all wanted. Tolerance to updates, Easy To understand, Reuseable component.
